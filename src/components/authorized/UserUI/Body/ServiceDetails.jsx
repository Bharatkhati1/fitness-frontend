                  Type 2 diabetes is a condition that happens because of a
                  problem in the way the body regulates and uses sugar as a
                  fuel.This long-term condition results in too much sugar
                  circulating in the blood. Eventually, high blood sugar levels
                  can lead to disorders of the circulatory, nervous and immune
                  systems.
